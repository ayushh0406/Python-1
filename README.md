My Python Eggs üêç üòÑ
I don't consider myself a programmer. I create these little programs as experiments to play with Python or to solve problems for myself. I'm happy to accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you have any comments, feel free to email me at: craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to reduce human workload and serve as educational examples for beginners to get started with Python. The code documentation is aligned correctly for viewing in Notepad++ :spiral_notepad:

Feel free to explore the scripts and use them for your learning and automation needs!
